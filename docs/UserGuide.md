## CSV Parser

Stores and loads data in with CSV files.

* Import data in CSV format: `import`
* Export data in CSV format: `export`

Our CSV files follow the following format:
1. All CSV files are header-less. Student data has exactly 2 columns: name, tags.
2. If a student has no tags, a comma representing the tags column is still required because [if a column is defined as optional, it means that the column is required to exist, but the value can be blank.](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/atlas-policy-suite/6.0.3?topic=files-rules-creating-populating-csv) 

Acceptable CSV format example:
```
Technoblade, Minecrafter Pig Anarchist
Meggy Spletzer,Inkling
John von Neumann,
```

### Import data in CSV format: `import` [in dev]
Import data in CSV format from file.

Format: `import [flag] [file path]`
* Flag -force overwrites existing records.
* Nothing is changed if file does not exist or file access denied.

### Export data in CSV format: `export` [coming soon]
Export data in CSV format to file.

Format: `export [flag] [file path]`
* If file exists, export is blocked unless -force flag is used. Otherwise, create file and export.
* Flag -force overwrites existing file.
* Nothing is changed if file access denied.
