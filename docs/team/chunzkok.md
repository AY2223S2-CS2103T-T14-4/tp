## Project: Teaching Assistant Assistant
Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for managing teaching assistant
activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAA can get
your teaching assistant tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Features
**Class Statistics ([PR #142](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/142))**
- **What it does:** Allows users to view statistics regarding the active class list's attendance and grades.
  - The attendance chart displays the number of students that have been marked as 'present' for each of the 12 weeks.
  - The grades chart displays a normal distribution generated using the mean and standard deviation of the scores of the students in the class, for a specific assignment.
- Imported and integrated library `JFreeChart` to help with chart drawing.
- Created helper methods to aggregate across different systems (i.e. `Assignment` and `Attendance` systems) to generate the relevant statistics.
