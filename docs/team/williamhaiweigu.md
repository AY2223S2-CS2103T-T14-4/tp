#Overview:
Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for managing teaching assistant
activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAA can get
your teaching assistant tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
