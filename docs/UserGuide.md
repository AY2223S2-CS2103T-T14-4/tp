## **Introduction**
### About this application
Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for managing teaching assistant activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

With TAA, you can easily track student attendance and grades using just a keyboard, eliminating the need for multiple clicks.
You can even view grade statistics without the use of a dedicated data analysis application!

### General
These commands are either used to interact with students across all class lists, or just general commands that are not related to any of the sections below:
- `list`
- `find`
- `clear`
- `help`

#### List all students : `list`
Lists all students tracked by TAA, across all class lists.

Format: `list`


#### Find a particular student : `find`
Find students across all classes whose names contain any of the specified keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`
- The given `KEYWORD`/`MORE_KEYWORDS` are not case-sensitive.

Examples:
- `find Alice Bob Charlie`
- `find bAlAKRiSHNan`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:page_with_curl: **Note:** A given keyword must exist as a whole word in a name for it to be considered as a match.
e.g. The keyword `bala` does not match the name `Roy Balakrishnan` as `Bala` is not the full word `Balakrishnan`.
</div>

#### Clear all students: `clear`
Removes all students currently being tracked by TAA.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">
:warning: **Warning:** This will delete all student records in TAA. Only use this command if you are sure you want to start off with a totally empty student list.
</div>


#### Display the help menu: `help`
Displays the help menu.

Format: `help`

![Help menu](images/HelpMenu.png)
<figcaption style="text-align:center"><em><strong>

### Attendance
For attendance, you can make the following calls:
* markAtd
* unmarkAtd
* listAtd

#### Mark attendance: `markAtd`
Marks the attendance of a student for that week<br>
Format: `markAtd STUDENT_INDEX w/WEEK_NUMBER`

`STUDENT_INDEX`: A positive integer that represents the index of student as shown in Class List display portion of TAA GUI<br>
`WEEK_NUMBER`: A integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive of both 1 and 12) <br>
Marking the attendance for a week that is already marked will result in
a message `This student's attendance has already been marked.`

Examples
* `markAtd 1 w/1` (marks attendance of student with index 1 for week 1)
* `markAtd 2 w/1` (marks attendance of student with index 2 for week 1)

#### Unmark attendance: `unmarkAtd`
Unmarks the attendance of a student for that week<br>
Format: `unmarkAtd STUDENT_INDEX w/WEEK_NUMBER`

`STUDENT_INDEX`: A positive integer that represents the index of student as shown in Class List display portion of TAA GUI <br>
`WEEK_NUMBER`: A integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive of both 1 and 12) <br>
Unmarking the attendance for a week that is already unmarked will just result in
the successful unmarking message being displayed `Attendance unmarked successfully!`

Examples
* `unmarkAtd 1 w/1` (unmarks attendance of student with index 1 for week 1)
* `unmarkAtd 2 w/1` (unmarks attendance of student with index 2 for week 1)

#### List Attendance: `listAtd`
Lists the attendance of a student from week 1 to week 12<br>
Format: `listAtd STUDENT_INDEX`

`STUDENT_INDEX`: A positive integer that represents the index of student as shown in Class List display portion of TAA GUI <br>

Examples
* `listAtd 1` (list attendance of student with index 1)
* `listAtd 2` (list attendance of student with index 2)

The listed attendance will be such that every line will be in the format `Week NUM: [PRESENT]` <br>
where `NUM` represents the week number, and `PRESENT` takes the value of `X` is the student is present, and empty otherwise

Example
* `Week 1: [X]` <br>
  `Week 2: [X]` <br>
  `Week 3: [X]` <br>
  `Week 4: []` <br>
  `Week 5: []` <br>
  `Week 6: []` <br>
  `Week 7: []` <br>
  `Week 8: []` <br>
  `Week 9: []` <br>
  `Week 10: []` <br>
  `Week 11: []` <br>
  `Week 12: []` <br>

The above example shows that the student is present for week 1,2,3 and absent for the rest of the weeks

### Participation
For participation, you can make the following calls:
* insertPP
* listPP

#### Clarifications on Participation points

* Participation points is represented by a integer from `0` to `700` (inclusive of both `0` and `700`) <br>
  Except for the special situation where the attendance is not marked, then the participation points will be `-1`
  If users are inserting participation points, only a integer from `0` to `700` (inclusive of both `0` and `700`) is allowed
* when the attendance of a student for a week is marked (not present -> present for the week) <br>
  Then the participation points of the student changes from `-1` to `0`
* Unmarking a student's attendance automatically changes the participation points of a student to `-1`
* The participation points displayed in Class List portion of the TAA GUI is the average points, which is calculated using `Total participation points` / `Number of weeks present` <br>
  `Total participation points` is the sum of all participation points for weeks when the student is present <br>
  `Number of weeks present` refers to the number of week present from week 1 to week 12


#### Insert participation points: `insertPP`
Inserts participation points of a student for that week<br>
Format: `insertPP STUDENT_INDEX w/WEEK_NUMBER pp/POINTS`

`STUDENT_INDEX`: A positive integer that represents the index of student as shown in Class List display portion of TAA GUI <br>
`WEEK_NUMBER`: A integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive of both 1 and 12) <br>
`POINTS`: A integer between 0 and 700 (inclusive of both 0 and 700)

Participation points can only be inserted for a week when the attendance is already marked. <br>
Violation of this will result in a message `Mark the attendance of the student first before inserting points!`

Examples
* `insertPP 1 w/1 pp/200` (inserts participation points of 200 for week 1 of student with index 1)
* `insertPP 2 w/1 pp/300` (inserts participation points of 200 for week 1 of student with index 2)

#### List participation points: `listPP`
Lists the participation points of a student from week 1 to week 12<br>
Format: `listPP STUDENT_INDEX`

`STUDENT_INDEX`: A positive integer that represents the index of student as shown in Class List display portion of TAA GUI <br>

Examples
* `listAtd 1` (list participation points of student with index 1)
* `listAtd 2` (list participation points of student with index 2)

The listed participation points will be such that every line will be in the format `Week NUM: [POINTS]` <br>
where `NUM` represents the week number, and `POINTS` is the participation points for that week

Example
* `Week 1: [200]` <br>
  `Week 2: [300]` <br>
  `Week 3: [400]` <br>
  `Week 4: [-1]` <br>
  `Week 5: [-1]` <br>
  `Week 6: [-1]` <br>
  `Week 7: [-1]` <br>
  `Week 8: [-1]` <br>
  `Week 9: [-1]` <br>
  `Week 10: [-1]` <br>
  `Week 11: [-1]` <br>
  `Week 12: [-1]` <br>

The above example shows that the student have a participation point of 200 for week 1, 300 for week 2, 400 for week 3 <br>
And -1 for the rest of the weeks (attendance is not marked)


### Assignments & Submissions

#### Preface

Assignment: A school assignment. Has an alphanumeric name, a non-negative integer total marks, and 
student submissions associated with it.

Submission: Linked to an assignment. Each student has a submission for every existing assignment.

For assignments & submissions, you can make the following calls:
* add_asgn
* delete_asgn
* grade
* ungrade
* list_asgn

#### Add Assignment: `add_asgn`

Adds an assignment with a specified name and total marks.

If the total marks for the assignment is unspecified, a default value of 100 will be given.

Student submissions for that assignment will be also created for all existing students.
All student submissions for that assignment will initially be ungraded.


Format: `add_asgn n/ASSIGNMENT_NAME [m/TOTAL_MARKS]`<br>
Example:
* `add_asgn n/Lab 1`
* `add_asgn n/Lab 2 m/50`

#### Delete Assignment: `delete_asgn`
Deletes the assignment of assignment_name you provided, along with the student submissions for that assignment.

Format: `delete n/ASSIGNMENT_NAME`<br>

Example:
* `delete_asgn n/Lab 1`

#### Grade Assignment: `grade`
Grades the student submission of assignment_name and student_id with the provided marks.

You can also indicate whether a student submission is late by adding "late/" at the end.

A submission can be graded multiple times, even if it is already graded. In that case, the latest
grade will be taken.

Format: `grade n/ASSIGNMENT_NAME i/STUDENT_ID m/MARKS [late/]`<br>
Example:
* `grade n/Lab 1 i/2 m/20`
* `grade n/Lab 1 i/3 m/30 late/`

#### Ungrade Assignment: `ungrade`
Resets the grade of the submission of assignment_name and student_id. It will also reset
the late submission status of the submission, if the submission was marked as late.

A submission can be ungraded multiple times, even if it is already ungraded. In that case, the subsequent ungrades
will have no effect.

Format: `ungrade n/ASSIGNMENT_ID i/STUDENT_ID`<br>
Example:
* `ungrade n/Lab 1 i/2`

#### List all assignments: `list_asgn`
Lists all assignments, submissions and their respective information.
Format: `list_asgn`

### Class List

#### Create a class list: `create_class`
Creates a class list to store the information about a group of students.

Format: `create_class LIST_NAME [STUDENT_NAMES]`
- The argument `LIST_NAME` should be the name of the new class list
  The argument `[STUDENT_NAMES]` should consist of a sequence of student names, separated by commas.


Examples:

- `add_student n/Harry cl/cs6244` adds Harry to the class CS6244

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:information_source: **Info:** If the class list `CLASS_NAME` does not exist, it will automatically be created with student
`STUDENT_NAME` as its first student
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip:** You can add a student to multiple classes at once! Just specify multiple `cl/` prefixes in your command. e.g. `add n/Harry cl/cs6244 cl/cs1231s`
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
:bulb: **Tip:** As `STUDENT_NAME` accepts alphanumeric inputs, student numbers such as `A1234567X` are perfectly valid student names!
</div>

#### Edit a student: `edit_student`
Edits a student in the active class list.

Format: `edit_student STUDENT_INDEX [n/STUDENT_NAME] [cl/CLASS_NAME]`
- The `STUDENT_INDEX` is the index of the student that is currently being shown on screen.
- At least one of the optional fields must be present. (i.e. either `STUDENT_NAME` and/or `CLASS_NAME`)

Examples:
- `edit_student 3 n/Barry Allen` changes the name of the 3rd student to "Barry Allen"
- `edit_student 5 cl/Tutorial_T14` assigns the 5th student only to the class "Tutorial_14"
- `edit_student 12 n/Tom Hanks cl/Lab_L11` changes the name of the 12th student to "Tom Hanks", and assigns
him to the class "Lab_L11"

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">
:warning: **Warning:**  The new fields will override the fields of the targeted student completely. i.e. to add an extra field, you will have to copy over the previous fields and add one additional parameter containing the new field to be added.
</div>

#### Delete a student: `delete_student`
Deletes a student from the active class list.

Format: `delete_student STUDENT_INDEX`
- The `STUDENT_INDEX` is the index of the student that is currently being shown on screen.

Examples:
- `delete_student 3` removes the 3rd student in the currently active/displayed class list

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:page_with_curl: **Note:** This command will delete the student with the given ID on the active class list, not from the list of all students obtained from using the `list` command.
</div>

#### View class statistics: `class_stats`
Displays statistics for the class, based on the specified field.

Format: `class_stats st/FIELD [as/ASSIGNMENT_NAME]`
- The argument `FIELD` must only be one of `attendance`/`grades`
- If `attendance` is entered as the `FIELD` parameter, then `ASSIGNMENT_NAME` is not required and will be ignored.
- If `grades` is entered as the `FIELD` parameter, then `ASSIGNMENT_NAME` is required.

Examples:
- `class_stats st/attendance` -- see Figure 4 below
- `class_stats st/grades as/Test 2` -- see Figure 5 below

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:page_with_curl: **Note:** To view grade statistics, the assignment `ASSIGNMENT_NAME` must have at least 2 graded submissions, and the submission grades must contain some variance. (i.e. if all the submissions are graded with the exact same marks, then no curve will be drawn as a normal distribution cannot be modelled with 0 variance.)
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:information_source: **Info:** The `FIELD` parameter is case-insensitive! 
i.e. `atTenDanCE`, while unusual, is still a valid argument to `FIELD`.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

### CSV Parser

Stores and loads data in with CSV files.

* Import data in CSV format: `import`
* Export data in CSV format: `export`

Our CSV files follow the following format:
1. All CSV files are header-less. Student data has exactly 5 columns: name, attendence, participation points,
   submissions, and tags.
2. All columns other than the name is optional, but a comma representing the tags column is still required
   because [if a column is defined as optional, it means that the column is required to exist, but the value can be blank.](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/atlas-policy-suite/6.0.3?topic=files-rules-creating-populating-csv)

Acceptable CSV format example:

```
Technoblade,1;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0,-1;-1;-1;-1;-1;-1;-1;-1;200;-1;-1;-1,"x,0,0,0,16;y,0,0,0,120;",Tut_T01;

#### Import data in CSV format: `import`

Import data in CSV format from file.

Format: `import [-force] FILE_PATH`
* Flag -force overwrites records of existing students.
* Nothing is changed if file does not exist or file access denied.

Successful import of a file containing the example data should display this:
![import result](./images/importResult.png)

#### Export data in CSV format: `export`

Export data in CSV format to file.

Format: `export [-force] FILE_PATH`
* If file exists, export is blocked unless -force flag is used. Otherwise, create file and export.
* Flag -force overwrites existing file.
* Nothing is changed if file access denied.

## **Appendix A: Planned Enhancements**

### 1. Allow multiple students with the same name to be added
Currently, users are unable to add a student with the same name as another student that already exists in TAA.
This could be troubling for tutors who have two students with the exact same name in the same class.

However, the current state of TAA is unable to provide sufficient information about students to distinguish between two students with the same name.
This should be doable only after TAA also has the ability to store student photos for each student (slated for future release), which would enable users to identify students using their names and portraits.
Therefore, we plan to implement this enhancement when TAA matures further to allow users to identify students with the same name correctly. 

This would be done by allowing the commands `add_student` and `edit_student` to succeed when using an existing student name, albeit with a warning "Note: A student with the same name already exists. If this is not what you intended, please undo this operation.".

### 2. Enhance input validation for the student name field
Currently, students with the same name, but with different capitalisations and whitespace positions are treated as different entities by TAA.
However, in the real world, this is unlikely the case. Such entities are likely to represent the same student, which can lead to confusion when users accidentally create multiple student entities for the same student as a result of a typo.

Therefore, we plan to further extend the checks performed on the student name provided to the commands `add_student` and `edit_student` that treats students with the same name, but different capitalisation and/or whitespace positions to be the same student.
Consequently, such operations will not be allowed to execute, and an error message "A student with a similar name already exists! Did you mean [student name]?" will be shown to the user instead.
