Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for managing teaching assistant activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAA can get your teaching assistant tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
