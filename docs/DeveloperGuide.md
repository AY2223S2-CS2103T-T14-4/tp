### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `TAA` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

**use case: mark attendance of a student**

**use case: unmark attendance of a student**

**use case: insert participation points of a student**

**Use case: delete a student**

**Use case: Add Assignment**
asgn_add

**Use case: Delete Assignment**
asgn_delete

**Use case: Grade Student Submission of an Assignment**
grade

**Use case: Ungrade Student Submission of an Assignment**
ungrade


**Use case: Add Class List** classlist 

**User case: List Student** list

**User case: SearchStudent** search

## **Mark/Unmark Attendance**

Mark and Unmark is very similar in nature and their implementation. <br>

Below is the main success scenario of Mark/Unmark


**MSS**

1. User requests to list all students in a class
2. TAA shows a list of students
3. User requests to mark attendance of a specific student in the list for a specified week
4. TAA marks attendance

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index/week is invalid.

    * 3a1. TAA shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 2.
* 3b. The given week's attendance is already marked

    * 3a1. TAA shows message that attendance for that week is already marked.

      Use case ends.

The Mark/Unmark commands are similar, and explanation will be done for Mark command

Mark command is facilitated by `MarkCommandParser`, `MarkAddressCommand` and `Model`

* `MarkCommandParser`-- Parse the input of users
* `MarkAttendanceCommand` -- Execute the command given the parsed user input
* `Model` -- Updates the attendance of student

Below is the sequence diagram for Marking attendane of a student

**deleting student**

1. User requests to list all students in a class
2. TAA shows a list of students
3. User requests to delete a specific student in the list
4. TAA deletes the student

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.

    * 3a1. TAA shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 2.

**list student**
1. User requests to list all students in a class.
2. TAA shows a list of students and number of students listed.

    Use case ends.

**search student**
1.  User requests to search for a particular student
2.  TAA shows the information of the student searched

    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. No student is found for the keyword.

  Use case ends.

**add classlist**
1.  User requests to add a new class list with a specific name.
2.  TAA adds the new class list with the name specified.
    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. Class list with the same name already exists.
  * 2a1. TAA shows an error message.
    Use case ends.

### Non-functional requirements

* All aspects of the system should work on Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems.
* The system should be easy to use by anyone who can type fast.
* The system should not crash or corrupt files under any input text.
* The system should respond within 1 second.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be
       optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases … }_

### Deleting a student

1. Deleting a student while all students are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all students using the `list` command. Multiple students in the list.

    1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.
       Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
       Expected: No student is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

1. _{ more test cases … }_

### Loading/Saving data in CSV format

Our CSV files follow the following format:

1. All CSV files are header-less. Student data has exactly 2 columns: name, tags.
2. If a student has no tags, a comma representing the tags column is still required
   because [if a column is defined as optional, it means that the column is required to exist, but the value can be blank.](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/atlas-policy-suite/6.0.3?topic=files-rules-creating-populating-csv)

Acceptable CSV format example:

```
Technoblade, Minecrafter Pig Anarchist
Meggy Spletzer,Inkling
John von Neumann,
```

1. Dealing with file access denial:
    * How to simulate: _TODO_
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   Access to the specified file is denied by system.
   ```
1. Dealing with file not exists:
    * How to simulate: use any string that is not a directory of any real file.
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   The specified file does not exist.
   ```
1. Dealing with file being a directory:
    * How to simulate: use a directory path.
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   The specified file path is a directory.
   ```
1. Dealing with FileReader throwing FileNotFoundException:
    * How to simulate: _TODO_
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   The specified file cannot be opened for reading.
   ```
1. Dealing with CSVParser throwing IOException:
    * How to simulate: _TODO_
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   An IOException occurred while reading specified file.
   ```
1. Dealing with ill-formatted CSV entry:
    * How to simulate: use csv files that contains inconsistent entries, unmapped columns, or fields violating their
      constraints.
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message indicating detailed entry that caused the error to
      user:

1. Dealing with at least 2 students in CSV file having same name:
    * How to simulate: use csv files that contains at least students with same name.
    * Expected behavior: doesn't change anything and show message indicating the specific student existing twice in
      file.
1. Dealing with adding student whose name already existed in list:
    * How to simulate: use csv files that contains student whose name already existed in list.
    * Expected behavior: If -force is used, replace the student in list. <p>
      Otherwise, doesn't change anything and show message indicating the specific student already existed in list to
      user.
