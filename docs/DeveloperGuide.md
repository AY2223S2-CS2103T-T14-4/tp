## **Teaching Assistant Assistant**
Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for managing teaching assistant activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAA can get your teaching assistant tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/taa/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/taa/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_student 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="654" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/taa/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/taa/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TaaParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TaaParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/taa/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the student data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/taa/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both student data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

Reading data from JSON:
* MainApp.initModelManager()
  * JsonTaaStorage.readTaaData()
    * JsonUtil.readJsonFile()
    * JsonSerializableTaaData.toModelType()

Saving data to JSON:
* LogicManager.execute()
  * ModelManager.getTaaData()
  * JsonTaaStorage.saveTaaData())
    * JsonUtil.saveJsonFile()
    * JsonSerializableTaaData.new()

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `taa.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

1.  User requests to add an alarm with specified time and comment.
2.  TAA adds the new alarm with the time and comment specified.
    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. User does not provide sufficient arguments
    * 2a1. TAA shows an error message.
      Use case ends.

Below is the sequence diagram for adding an alarm.

**delete alarm**
1.  User requests to delete a scheduled alarm with specified index.
2.  TAA deletes the alarm with the specified index, the alarm will no longer ring.
    Use case ends.

**Extensions**
* 2a. User does not provide sufficient arguments
    * 2a1. TAA shows an error message.
      Use case ends.
* 2b. User does not provide a valid index
    * 2a1. TAA shows an error message.
      Use case ends.

**list alarm**
1.  User requests to list all scheduled alarms.
2. TAA shows all scheduled alarms on the command window.

**Extensions**
* 2a. There is no alarms scheduled.
    * 2a1. TAA shows an error message.
      Use case ends.

### Non-functional requirements

* All aspects of the system should work on Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems.
* The system should be easy to use by anyone who can type fast.
* The system should not crash or corrupt files under any input text.
* The system should respond within 1 second.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be
       optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦ }_

### Deleting a student

1. Deleting a student while all students are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all students in the class using the `classlist Tutorial_T01` command. Multiple students in the list.

    1. Test case: `delete_student 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.
       Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    1. Test case: `delete_student 0`<br>
       Expected: No student is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete_student`, `delete_student x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦ }_

### Loading/Saving data in CSV format

Our CSV files follow the following format:

1. All CSV files are header-less. Student data has exactly 2 columns: name, tags.
2. If a student has no tags, a comma representing the tags column is still required
   because [if a column is defined as optional, it means that the column is required to exist, but the value can be blank.](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/atlas-policy-suite/6.0.3?topic=files-rules-creating-populating-csv)

Acceptable CSV format example:

```
Technoblade, Minecrafter Pig Anarchist
Meggy Spletzer,Inkling
John von Neumann,
```

1. Dealing with file access denial:
    * How to simulate: _TODO_
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   Access to the specified file is denied by system.
   ```
1. Dealing with file not exists:
    * How to simulate: use any string that is not a directory of any real file.
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   The specified file does not exist.
   ```
1. Dealing with file being a directory:
    * How to simulate: use a directory path.
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   The specified file path is a directory.
   ```
1. Dealing with FileReader throwing FileNotFoundException:
    * How to simulate: _TODO_
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   The specified file cannot be opened for reading.
   ```
1. Dealing with CSVParser throwing IOException:
    * How to simulate: _TODO_
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message to user:
   ```
   An IOException occurred while reading specified file.
   ```
1. Dealing with ill-formatted CSV entry:
    * How to simulate: use csv files that contains inconsistent entries, unmapped columns, or fields violating their
      constraints.
    * Expected behavior: Doesn't change anything and show message indicating detailed entry that caused the error to
      user:

1. Dealing with at least 2 students in CSV file having same name:
    * How to simulate: use csv files that contains at least students with same name.
    * Expected behavior: doesn't change anything and show message indicating the specific student existing twice in
      file.
1. Dealing with adding student whose name already existed in list:
    * How to simulate: use csv files that contains student whose name already existed in list.
    * Expected behavior: If -force is used, replace the student in list. <p>
      Otherwise, doesn't change anything and show message indicating the specific student already existed in list to
      user.
